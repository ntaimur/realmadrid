        <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo <br> <br>
            Arguably the greatest of all time, Cristiano Ronaldo left Manchester United to join <br>
            Real Madrid in 2009. In his time at Madrid, Ronaldo managed to score an astounding <br>
            451 goals in just 438 games. He also won 4 Champions League titles with Real Madrid.<br>
            This included Real Madrid's infamous UCL 3-peat in 2016, 2017, and 2018. <br>
            Cristiano also won 4 Ballon D'ors while at Real Madrid. He eventually left the club <br>
            in 2018. However, he cemented his status as a club legend during his stay, and is still the <br>
            club's top scorer to this day.
